if you want to build this project from source make sure you have Love2d portable, python 3.13.0 and pyinstaller

1. in python/ directory you can see qr.py, use pyinstaller to make an exe out of qr.py

2. delete all the cache files generated by pyinstaller and move the exe from python/dist/<Executablename>.exe to python/<Executablename.exe>

3. rewrite "local command = [[py ..\\python\\qr.py "]] .. image_path" in libs/qr.lua to "local command = [[..\\python\\<Executablename>.exe "]] .. image_path"

4. for making an Executable for the app you can follow this tutorial https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution by love2d and search for "Creating a Windows Executable"
